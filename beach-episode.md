# beach episode 

Turing at the beach, having a good time, frolicking. not really one hundo on the pose yet, actually a little open to some input on that one tbh, but there are some details I have pretty specific ideas on. one is the swim trunks and the other is a specific drone I wanted included in the pic. will detail below. 

as far as how Turing looks in the pic, just keep in mind that he is a fairly typical twink. the only exception to that, Turing has no nipples. 

I was thinking this could be used as a phone background (like the music player), but I got a new phone and the dimensions are **2796 by 1290 pixels** now. 

## trunks 

should be short but baggy, loose fitting, and bright yellow. instead of the typical crinkle you see on swim trunks, I want something that looks more intentional where the trunks have been intentionally creased to look like shattered glass. refer to fig. 1a for some idea of what that would look like. I was hoping to have the light play off of that in some interesting ways where some of the triangles are bright white while others are in a bit of shadow. for length, look at fig. 1b, but ignore the way those trunks are tight around the leg (keep it baggy). 

I have one problem with the way fig. 1 looks tho. I don't like that there are lines in the creases. I want the trunks to look like a single piece of fabric with subtle creases in it. one way to conceptualize it would be to imagine a fabric that could be laid flat on a table and appear totally flat with no folds or imperfections, but the moment you pick it up or move it, it deforms with these triangle shapes.

## drone

where the drone goes is a little up to you, but since I was thinking this might be done with an upward angle (similar to its Inspiration) the drone could be flying in one of the corners, close to Turing's head. the important part is what it looks like, I want it to be the drone shown in all the fig. 2 pics. I can totally provide more pics as needed.
