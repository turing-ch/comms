# emotes

hoping to make this a "living document (tm)" of all the emotes I want to commission. the idea being to only ever add to it and mark things that have been commissioned as complete. 

## list 

- [ ] [mlem](emotes.md#mlem) 
- [ ] [copium](emotes.md#copium)
- [ ] [note](emotes.md#note) 
- [ ] [peek](emotes.md#peek) 
- [ ] [head pats](emotes.md#head%20pats) 

## mlem

based on the phone background thingy below. just the thing from the middle of it. pretty self explanatory.

## copium 

![copium](https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2021-08%2F79649079-d0e7-4acd-853b-6a2b92797da3%2Fcopium_png.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1.0&w=400) 

## note 

Turing looking over a notebook with a pencil. you can only see the top half of the pencil (since it's writing in the notebook). about half of Turing's face is obscured by the notebook. **can send a ref, but I'll have to do it in discord, remind me if I forget.** 

## peek 

thinking of going with the peeking in from one side as opposed to peeking up from the bottom. I think these are pretty standard but here is a ref of what I mean by "in from the side".

## wicked 
this but with Turing wearing a similar pair of sunglasses made by Oakley. mostly just using the Oakleys as a color reference. I think the major things to capture here are pose for Turing and the color swap for the glasses.
